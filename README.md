This library provides an interface with the Kalshi exchange. You can find the Kalshi API
documentation here: https://trading-api.readme.io/reference/getting-started/.
Kalshi has a demo env (https://demo.kalshi.co) where we can test our code.
We also currently have a local "fake" instance of the Kalshi exchange that mocks the Kalshi
endpoints. Please do not use production credentials unless we are legally cleared for trading.
We do not intend to trade real money for the forseeable future; therefore, this repository
is currently only for educational and research purposes unless there is a change in the
direction of the project.

You need to set up some authorization. See the Auth class for what env vars and files you need.
