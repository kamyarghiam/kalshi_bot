This library provides an interface with the Kalshi exchange. It is currnetly
not set up for public use, but I decided to make this repo public so that people
can take ideas from what I'm working on. Note: I am no longer affiliated with
Kalshi and this is my own project. The most useful files for external viewing are under
src/exchange. Feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions or ideas.

You can find the Kalshi API
documentation here: https://trading-api.readme.io/reference/getting-started/.
Kalshi has a demo env (https://demo.kalshi.co) where I test my code.
I also currently have a local "fake" instance of the Kalshi exchange that mocks the Kalshi
endpoints.
